  <h2 class="title">Anti-viral: Snapchat’s Discover: Virality, Ephemerality, and the New Magazine Form.</h2>

  <p class="byline">By Troy O’Neill, edited by Andreas Eckhardt-Læssøe.</p>


   
  <p class="lede">Everyone in the media industry is right to be scared by Snapchat’s new Discover feature. Discover, a news publishing utility that was released late this past January, is gaining momentum as a new way to produce and distribute content, threatening to dramatically change the way news is consumed. With an estimated 200 million monthly users, Snapchat’s immense popularity  means that the Discover feature could be a holy grail for advertisers and small publications alike, because they can promise unique connectivity with younger audiences.</p>

  The Discover feature presents magazines and websites that independently curate their own multimedia content, which disappears after twenty four  hours. Dependent on where you live, your options would include Fusion, Cosmopolitan, Vice, The Daily Mail, Yahoo, Vice, CNN, Comedy Central, People Magazine, ESPN, and others. Media on the app varies from videos, interactive multimedia articles, and quizzes, but are all mobile-native and designed to be read like pages in a book or magazine. Each content generator on Discover also features advertising, which marks one of the first attempts that Snapchat has made to generate revenue for the company. 

  If taken seriously, Discover’s break from the viral news cycle of publications like Huffington Post and Buzzfeed spells something new for the way that news is consumed. Suddenly, news stories are not something to be quickly shared, but read for their own sake. Unconstrained from this type of length and form, Vice is able to publish long articles on Mitt Romney’s charity boxing match and the Daily Mail can publish essays on human encounters with dead relatives. This content is different from its competitors because every article is designed in conversation with Snapchat’s ephemeral medium. Hence, in Snapchat, the medium is not only the message; the medium works in tandem with the experienced reality of the consumer in a way that points to the future of our digitally mediated relationship with technology.

  This relationship is marked by a constant conversation with digital content; instead of being passive consumers of media on their newsfeed or homepage, users interact with media without the pretense that it will exist indefinitely. In this sense, the radical thing about Discover is not its ephemerality, but the larger digital economy that it creates. Discover’s media content isn’t meant to be shared — all of the content is housed in the app, and doesn’t include any links to outside material.  Its ephemerality means that it doesn’t allow the snowballing effect of viral media. This means content on Discover will never be irrelevant like its Buzzfeed counterpart because its value doesn’t change in reference to the amount of clicks it has or how old it is. *It simply exists until it disappears forever.*

  What does this mean for the future of the digital media industry? I sat down with Nathan Jurgenson, a social media theorist and researcher for Snapchat, in a cafe near his home in Bushwick to find out. Jurgenson began working with Snapchat in 2013 after publishing work on social media ephemerality in [The New Inquiry](http://thenewinquiry.com), where he is a contributing editor. As both an academic and a member of Snapchat’s team, Jurgenson has enough critical distance to both recognize this and see how Discover has already changed the way that we think about news media. Jurgenson’s past work has revolved around social media photography and the digitally mediated experience of reality; he has written about the [IRL Fetish](http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-irl-fetish/), the [Facebook Eye](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/01/the-facebook-eye/251377/), and [Online Privacy](http://www.wired.com/2014/03/privacy-is-dead/). He is currently a graduate student in sociology at The University of Maryland and is also finishing a book on social media and photography with Penguin Press. 

  Once he started talking, his calm demeanor gave way to genuine excitement: he truly believes that Snapchat has the ability to dramatically change how digital media is produced and shared.  In a world where conversations online and offline run seamlessly, and digital personas are just as important as physical ones, Jurgenson believes that our everyday experiences are intrinsically connected to the digital technologies that we use. In the context of Discover, this means that, for the first time, news media is being produced with an understanding of its relationship to its own form and consumption. When I asked about current trends in the media and publishing industry, Jurgenson identified recent changes to news media companies like Upworthy as something to look out for in 2015.  

  ###### Troy O’Neill: Can you tell me about your upcoming book?

  Nathan Jurgenson: I haven’t announced it yet, but it’s a book from Penguin Press, it’s a book on photography and social media. 

  In most books on photography, you pick them up and they are all about art. Art in galleries and museums, or by journalists, or more professional photography. This is only a sliver of a sliver of the types of photos taken today. While, the majority of pictures taken today are things like if I take a picture of my coffee and send it to a friend. The photo world has nothing to say about that. They might do art readings of that photo, but it’s like… you guys missed it. 

  <p class="pullquote">The majority of pictures taken today are things like if I take a picture of my coffee and send it to a friend. The photo world has nothing to say about that. They might do art readings of that photo, but it’s like… you guys missed it.</p>

  It’s not about the object, we will throw it away. That is not the point. The point is the way that it is communicated. I am treating photography more linguistically, more like a speech act, rather than the ends of the photographic process, rather than the object or thing that we can frame or hang in a gallery or dissect in a book. 

  ###### Would you say that social media photography is not a product? 

  I mean, there is an object, there is a product, but I think that the means have switched. Traditionally, the end of the photograph is the photo object. What it contains, the communicative property or action, the meaning being expressed, are the means. I think that we could flip that today, where the object is the means, and the end is what is being communicated. I think that we see that in the disposability of photographs. Not just on Snapchat, but on any network. 

  The difference between any of these networks is that they have minimal senses of ephemerality.  [For Snapchat,] the photo really does disappear most of the time, unless it is screenshotted or something like that — but de facto things on your Instagram disappear. People aren’t really looking at the things that you are posting yesterday, right? It just goes right down the stream. I think that Snapchat is just a more honest reflection on what social photography had already become. Which already is largely ephemeral. For example, nobody is paying attention to that photo that you posted on May 14, 2007 on Facebook. It might as well have been ephemeral. Yet we have a piling up of images. It makes more sense to treat them as they are, for no other reason than so the important photos can be special. Instead of keeping everything, if you choose to keep them, then I think that those photos can be important and special in a way that social photos rarely are. 

  ###### Like photos on Facebook?

  Yeah, like if there are a few that you think are important and you want to keep, right now those are just in the pile of all of the other photos. We all know the burden of trying to find one specific photo when there are so many, and you have these albums that scroll on forever. What we need is a process to make some of them more important, instead of permanent by default. I think that if we made things ephemeral by default, the photos that we think are really important could be made more important. 

  It’s like money. If you print too much money in abundance, you have inflation. I think that we have an inflation of visual imagery. I think that we need a little bit more scarcity for our own identity and our records of our everyday lives. I think that it will be like a pendulum, in that it moves from abundance to scarcity, so images can become more valuable again. I think that collectively we are dealing with this back and forth. 

  ###### It also seems more fragmentary. In terms of the way that data is structured, what kind of difference in model do you see for Snapchat versus Facebook? 

  Obviously with the news last year, with Facebook’s [emotional manipulation study](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full)… people didn’t think that their newsfeeds were being reorganized, or that they were collecting data on them. It’s assumed it’s some sort of natural process. People think the same thing with Google — like it is this natural or essential thing, like that is the way it “must be ordered.” It is nice in this moment to say no, this information that is ordered by algorithms isn’t a naturally occurring phenomenon. They are built by specific people with specific politics, interests, and goals. You take your Facebook newsfeed or your Google search — they all reflect human politics, nothing “natural.” 


  For example, Snapchat’s ads aren’t targeted, and advertisers love targeted ads. It is pitched as the holy grail of advertising — that you can pitch your product to 18-year-old guys who live in Bushwick — but there is none of that on the Snapchat network; everybody gets the same ad. There is no algorithmically sorted content with the exception of friend groups and Discover,  which changes with where you live. For example, if you are in Argentina, you will have a different Discover than if you lived in the UK. 

  As far as differences between the way that Snapchat uses data, it’s not really a part of Snapchat right now, but it is the foundation of Facebook. Facebook’s newsfeed is ordered by algorithms, which is based on many things.  [Facebook] would say it is based on what you want to see, which is operationalized by your time on the site. With the emotional manipulation study, they found that if you see a lot of positive words or a lot of negative words, then you are more likely to spend more time on the site and you would post more as well. So it’s better for them to take emotionally charged words and give that more weight in the algorithm, because everything that shows up on your newsfeed works as a likelihood. Some of the variables get more ability to influence and others get less, and they all hit this piece of content that gets a likelihood score. That is all part of their business model; be it that you more likely to spend more time on a site, if you more likely to post more things, or if you hit like more often — that information is for sale. 

  So you can spend money to bump up that likelihood score even up to 100 percent, so that every 19 year old in Bushwick sees that post. That is something that is for sale. So that is mostly [Facebook’s] business model. And for journalism that is really an interesting thing because they have at the bottom right of the screen little trending news stories. They don’t really seem to know what they are doing with it yet, but the newsfeed reflects promoted posts, and what news stories show in that bottom reflects the newsfeed. Therefore, the way that they sorted the news stories is for sale to some degree. 

  ###### How does Snapchat’s structure affect its users? 

  I think that there are a lot of things built into the app that have more of a tactile or intimate feel, and the fact that things disappear really heightens the intimacy of the moment. In that New Inquiry essay, I said that you have to look fast and look hard.  Because it’s a ticking tock, there is a countdown, the moment becomes special. When everything is safe forever, any particular moment isn’t special. The moment can just happen later. So there isn’t any newness; that is really the problem that I have with a lot of social media. It is kind of nostalgic, in that the present never just gets to be the present. It’s kind of like having a tape recorder on during the conversation, for a future-past. Like, in the future this is going to be the past, and that is what the present is for. But if we were just friends hanging out in a coffee shop chatting, it would be really weird if one of us just put a tape recorder down. All of social media is designed to say, “Let’s just do that!”

  People have called Snapchat radical for deleting everything, but that’s not radical, that’s just familiar. It was everything else that was radical. This is the way that social interaction has always been.  It has always been ephemeral. In social media we started with the idea of “let’s put everything that we see down and share it with everyone for all time.” I think that it leads to many things, when we talk about privacy, or a transparent society, but to me it’s more mundane than that — things like the nostalgia that we are collectively looking at the world with, that we see the world always as a potential future-past. I think that it is kind a of a conservative view of the world, because it’s all about freezing the world and putting it into categories, which are then ranked by things like likes and retweets. 

  [Social media] needs to be less about the self: putting the self into categories, saving it, or preserving it. Facebook is the model of preserving the museum of the self. I think that there is room for some of that, but it shouldn’t be by default. I think that Snapchat isn’t anti-nostalgic — the present just stays in the present. It does a better job getting at the everyday.  Maybe Instagram does better with the life trophies, those special moments, but in between those special moments, if you are posting all time, you are just going to be oversharing. I think that ephemerality gets at the everydayness, which, as a sociologist, we kind of know that that is the fabric of existence. I think that it is healthy for social media to encompass that in addition to the special moments. 

  <p class="pullquote">When we focus on ephemerality, we understand that the internet is real too. I think that the psyche of social media is built on the idea that we have real life, and then you create a document of it and put it somewhere separate, somewhere virtual. To me, Facebook is modeling a second life.</p>


  ###### Is that ephemerality more real? 

  No, I have read people say that and I cringe every time. I think that the difference is that it is all real. When we focus on ephemerality, we understand that the internet is real too. I think that the psyche of social media is built on the idea that we have real life, and then you create a document of it and put it somewhere separate, somewhere virtual. To me, Facebook is modeling a second life. 

  It’s a document double of existence, which then we can rank, put a score on everything, it is all categorized, and searchable, kind of how Google treats information, like “let’s go index it all, put it in a database in order to show that it is searchable.” That is the underpinnings of social life. They are trying to make information equivalent to everything that we do, to put it in various variables in a database and make it searchable, like the Facebook graph search.  [But] it’s not how humans understand their own lives. [Facebook] built that search and nobody used it, and I think it made complete sense on their end, like, “social life is a database, and now we can search it,” but that’s not how people use it. That’s not how Facebook works. 

  We get our complexity from how contradictory we are all of the time; we don’t fit into the databases as nicely and easily as I think the data scientists that build that social media think. They are always ranking our moods. Anybody who studies happiness studies knows that we don’t work like that, like some people are happy to be sad. It doesn’t fit that way, like maybe Russia scores really low on happiness, but they might enjoy being sad. It doesn’t make sense that happiness sits on a linear scale of one to ten. 

  ###### Is that what you mean about augmented reality? 

  It’s a term I don’t use a ton. I want to get at the idea that there is one reality, and that this is opposed to what I call digital dualism.

  ###### Which is a term that you came up with. 

  Yeah, it’s a term that I coined. I was originally looking for a word that described a mixed reality where we have just one reality. I ended up coming up with that term for the fallacy that there is some cyber reality, like the Matrix, like there is some virtual cyber world. I never did come up with a term that I love, because it’s just reality.

  I think that it is so funny that when it comes to the digital, we talk in spatial terms, like online or offline, cyberspace or virtual world. We don’t do that for text, we don’t do that for oral information. If you open up a book, you don’t go, “Oh alright, I’m going to jack into the text space and log into the word world.” We leave that for the digital. I think that we have one reality and the digital is just one flavor of information in this reality. The digital is just one more type of information that we have. That’s what I mean by augmented reality; this perspective means that reality has always been augmented. Now we just have one more form of mediation to talk about. Really, it’s been a preoccupation for all of modernity. When we think about what the enlightenment was, saying that we have to figure out what the world “is,” that we have to put light upon it and learn it, this presupposes that you don’t know everything, while before it was clear that you knew a lot. For example, if you were religious you knew the world; you knew when it started and you knew when it ended. Today, for a very long time now, we have been living in a state of an unknowable world.  That creates a lot of anxiety, and our history of social theory has been grappling with that. It used to be that your self, your identity, was something that was presupposed — you didn’t have to choose it. In fact, there was no question about it. 

  ###### And in social media now, you are carefully constructing the self.

  Now you are constantly doing that. That is an obsession all of the time. And what is funny about social media is that we have come up with this little trick to solve that problem that we have been obsessed with for a very long time: What is true, what is an authentic person, you know an authentic self. I think that we really like the idea that “people aren’t communicating in real life anymore, they are just tweeting virtually.” What that does is it makes those person’s everyday conversation even more real. Now, people will talk, “oh I’m going to leave my phone at home or on the weekends,” and it really makes them feel that “this” is more real. I am more true and authentic because I don’t have my phone or computer. And I love to disconnect and unplug, I just don’t think that its right to call it more real or true or authentic. 

  ###### How does Discover differ from something that you would see on your Facebook newsfeed? 

  It is not in the viral cycle. When I say viral, I don’t mean it just as a metric of popularity, but as a genre of content. The thing about viral things is that we love them for a moment and then we hate them. In fact, if you care about it too late you look out of touch. You only want to share something at the beginning, which is partly why things go viral, because we are all rushing to share it before our friends do. Discover’s news comes out once a day, so it has much more of a magazine feel than viral news does. It’s not a platform for breaking news, it’s not meant to be that kind of thing.

  That is how Discover is designed. When you put the like button on everything, without a dislike button, you are encouraging people to post likable content. So for that like button, the affordances of the network produce some kind of behavior. That is the best way of thinking about how these sites structure behavior. Sometimes it’s very subtle, just as Facebook’s emotional manipulation study highlighted. We don’t know how we are necessarily being manipulated, but that is all a part of the affordances of the network. And that is not new to social media. If you go into the grocery store, and if you go to the checkout line, there is a rack of impulse buys, and you will notice things that kids will like are closer to their eye level, while the things that you will like are closer to your eye level. Our whole world is constructed in this way; we are being manipulated in subtle ways. 

  ###### What are the affordances of the Discover section? 

  Every design feature leads to different affordances. In Discover, it’s that you can’t scroll up or down. There are these flat circles. You get these cards and you have to swipe left or right, or up or down. Those are all the affordances of the network. 

  And this is what created that feature in the first place. We thought about what affordances were current. We thought that most young people were getting news from their social feeds that are algorithmically curated. Discover is very much editorially curated — there are no algorithms, that is not what is popular. So, somebody at CNN is deciding [the news] rather than the algorithm on Facebook’s newsfeed. Those are radically different affordances and you are going to get radically different news — when it’s what is likable versus what an editor would pick. I’m not saying that one is necessarily better or worse, as we have had editors selecting news for a very long time. We have also had this viral news competitor sitting next to it and I think that they both have pluses and minuses. 

  ###### Does that give us a new way to think about media in the future? 

  Yeah. We had that moment where everyone was going to design a beautiful magazine for an iPad. That was going to save magazines, which obviously didn’t come to pass. People aren’t waking up and firing up the Cosmo app on their iPad. That was something that people envisioned when the iPad first came out. I think that Discover is the next take on what a digital magazine might look like. I, personally, think that it has a magazine feel. To me it has a glossy feel, the full screen ads feel like a full page advertisement that would be in a magazine.

  If you would have asked me a year ago, I would have said that virality, this sort of viral nature to everything, sorted by likes and clicks was not going to be the future. Now it seems a little bit redundant because Snapchat has made something that isn’t based on likes or clicks. There are no likes or shares within the platform. Since that is what has been built it doesn’t actually sound like the future anymore. I think that this viral cycling will happen for virality itself; I feel like we are going to be sick of that genre in the same way that we are going to be sick of individual things within that genre. So I wonder, what happens after viral goes viral? We will see if attention and clicks are something that can be saved as a legit currency. If I’m right, I feel like clicks are going to become an increasingly unimportant metric and advertisers are going to start not being willing to pay by the click. I see it declining, which might mean a decline in viral as a culture to begin with.
